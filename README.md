This program is a 3d ray tracer. This program uses semi-realtime rendering, Monte Carlo ray reflection, GPU acceleration, and global illumination (GI). The default scene depicts the Cornell Box.
It was written using C++, GLSL, SFML, and Bash.

The algorithms used in this repo are based online lectures from MIT 6837 by Justin Solomon.

To run the code, you first must install SFML version 2.x.x (the latest version of SFML does not currently work).
Then, run `./start`, to compile the code and open the renderer.
